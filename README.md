# Dogs-Cats-Image-Classifier

- In this case, I am working on classifier on image cats and dogs.

Step by Step Set up in Jupyter Notebook :
- directory for train and validate data.
- dimension of our image.
- parameters for NN model.
- Image data generator(Generates more images for better results/more generalized model)
- a basic CNN structure - feature detection layer(convolution2D , activation and pooling layer) then pass it to classification layer (Fully Connected , activation layer).
- Compile model
- Fit model 
- Plot accuracy and loss 
- Way of Improvement- adding regularization(dropout, recurrent dropout, L1, L2, pooling, early stopping)
